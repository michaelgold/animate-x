# AnimateX: Advanced Temporal Modeling for Animation (Unofficial Implementation)

## Overview

This is an unofficial implementation of AnimateX, an innovative approach to animation generation that leverages advanced temporal modeling techniques. This implementation combines sophisticated video preprocessing with deep learning models to capture and generate complex temporal dependencies in animated sequences.

## Key Components

### Video Preprocessing

The approach begins with a robust video preprocessing pipeline:

1. **Frame Extraction**: Individual frames are extracted from input videos using OpenCV.
2. **Pose Estimation**: A DWPose model is used to extract pose information from each frame.
3. **Caption Generation**: A CogVLM2-Llama3-Caption model generates descriptive captions for the videos.

### AnimateX Model

The AnimateX model consists of several key components:

1. **Latent Diffusion Model**: Includes a VAE (AutoencoderKL) and a UNet2DConditionModel.
2. **CLIP Models**: Uses CLIP text and vision encoders for conditioning.
3. **Mamba**: Implements a Mamba model for temporal modeling.
4. **Pose Indicators**:
   - **Implicit Pose Indicator (IPI)**: Processes CLIP features and pose sequences.
   - **Explicit Pose Indicator (EPI)**: Generates explicit pose representations using convolutional layers and a pose pool.

## Approach

1. **Video Input**: The system takes raw video data as input in MP4 or AVI format.

2. **Preprocessing**: Videos undergo frame extraction, pose estimation, and caption generation.

3. **Pose Representation**: The preprocessed data is fed into the Implicit and Explicit Pose Indicators to generate comprehensive pose representations.

4. **Temporal Modeling**: The Mamba model processes the combined pose representations to capture temporal dependencies.

5. **Animation Generation**: The model generates animations using the processed features and conditioning information.

## Key Advantages

- **Advanced Pose Estimation**: Utilizes DWPose for accurate pose extraction.
- **Rich Conditioning**: Incorporates both visual (CLIP) and textual (captions) conditioning.
- **Efficient Temporal Processing**: The use of Mamba allows for effective modeling of temporal dependencies.
- **Flexibility**: The modular design allows for easy integration into larger animation generation pipelines.

## Usage

1. Prepare your video data in MP4 or AVI format.
2. Run the preprocessing script to extract pose data and generate captions:
   ```
   python preprocess.py --data_dir /path/to/videos --config_path config/config.yaml
   ```
3. Configure the model parameters in `config/config.yaml`.
4. Train the model:
   ```
   python train.py
   ```
5. Use the trained model for animation tasks (refer to specific task documentation).

## Configuration

The system is highly configurable through the `config/config.yaml` file, allowing easy adjustment of key parameters for both preprocessing and model architecture.

## Evaluation Metrics

The model uses several metrics for evaluation:
- Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID)
- Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM)
- Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS)

## Dependencies

Key dependencies include:
- PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning
- Transformers and Diffusers libraries
- OpenCV
- Mamba-ssm

For a complete list, refer to the `requirements.txt` file.

## Future Work

Potential areas for future enhancement include:
- Exploration of alternative pose estimation techniques
- Integration of more advanced temporal modeling architectures
- Incorporation of multi-scale temporal processing for handling varying motion speeds and complexities
